# Zencoder

A Python module for the [Zencoder](http://zencoder.com) API

## Installation
Eventually I'll get around to putting this in the cheeseshop, when that happens you can install with easy_install:
    easy_install zencoder
or with pip:
    pip install zencoder

## Dependencies
zencoder-py depends on [httplib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/)
it uses the json module, which is only in 2.6 python or greater
and will depend on some package for xml
